aldb - The Alloy DeBugger
=========================

aldb allows its users to easily gain an understanding
of why their Alloy models don't work.

Development
===========

Building
--------
Use `bin/build` to build an executable jar. This jar will be located at
`build/aldb.jar`.

Cleaning
--------
Use `bin/clean` to remove all compiled files.

Running
-------
Use `bin/aldb` to run the program.

Testing
-------
Use `bin/test` to run the main test runner. Note that it will not
necessarily run all tests -- it only runs the tests it has been supplied
with.

Style
-----
This project approximately follows the Sun code conventions. Its style
rules are enumerated in `checkstyle.xml`. Use `bin/style` to check the
code for style errors.
